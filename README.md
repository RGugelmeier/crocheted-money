# Crocheted Stuffy Goal Tracker

This app was made specifically for my wife who owns a crochet business where she makes crochet stuffies (She is called the Cuddle Market, which you can check out on Instgram). She is keeping track right now of how much money worth of stuffies she has crocheted, with a goal of 1000 by the end of the year.

## Features

- Goal tracker: This app keeps track of the current goal of 1000, as well as the current progress towards that goal.
- Custom progress submission: To add progress towards the goal, you may use the numpad built into the main webpage. Once the number displayed shows what value you would like to add, simply click "Enter" to submit it to the tracker.
- Quick-add plushies: My wife has some common stuffies that she makes many times, as they are very popular. Using the quick add list, you can simply click a button to add the value of that stuffy to the progression.
  - Adding quick-add plushies: If a new plushy becomes something that is made many times, you can add it to the quick add list. This opens a modal window where you can enter the stuffy name and price.

## TODO

I want to make some minor changes to this app, but it is mostly finished. The following is what I want to change:

- Making the app look better. Right now it uses some basic boilerplate css to make it not just raw HTML, but I want to make this app look cuter, which is to say it should look more close like an app designed for crocheted stuffed animals.
- I want you to be able to modify quick add plushies in the list in case you made a mistake creating one, the price has changed, or you no longer make this specific plushy often enough to warrant it being on the quick add list.
- Add some sort of animation when the goal is complete.
- Add the ability to reset the goal tracker so this app can be re-used.
- Add the ability to modify the goal in case you set it too high or too low.
